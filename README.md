## INTRODUCTION

- A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious form of cyber attack where a large number of internet connected devices are used to overload a specific target such as a server, website or online service. The main objective of a DDoS attack is to make the target inaccessible to the legitimate public, causing an interruption in the normal functioning of the service.
- These attacks exploit a system's limited processing power, bandwidth, or resources so that it cannot handle the high volume of bogus traffic generated by compromised devices. Attackers often take control of these compromised devices remotely, forming a "botnet" (network of bots) to carry out the attack.

## Algorithm

- This algorithm makes each worker make 20 HTTP GET calls to each endpoint
- As in the algorithm list I have a total of 12 endpoints, so each worker will make 240 GET requests
- Giving a total of 240 x 8 = 1920 GET requests in parallel, at the same time.
- The 8 workers finish making these requests in about 200-350 milliseconds.

## CONCLUSION

- I made this algorithm for didactic purposes, and for pure curiosity/technical interest.
